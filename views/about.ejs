<p>The Gothic is often misunderstood as a ghost story. In other words, it is often understood as a depiction of horrifying fiction, but fiction all the same. While this understanding is not incorrect in its reasoning, it is fairly limiting. It limits our scope of what we deem Gothic, and it limits our nuanced analysis of works that aren’t explicitly Gothic, but upon another look, in fact are.</p>

<p>Traditional examples of the Gothic, however, are helpful tools to determine the genre’s essence, which we can then apply to other works with a more nuanced eye. Charles Brockden Brown tells us that the id, the other, the thing that we separate from ourselves, is much closer to us than we think. He raises the question, “who is the true monster?” and concludes that we, that is, humans, are. Edgar Allan Poe tells us that the Gothic is the perverse. In “The Black Cat,” he defines this “perverseness” as an overwhelming sexual impulse – a “primitive impulse of the human heart… [that] give[s] direction to the character of man.”(273). He intimates that in the end, Perverseness originates inside us. Nathaniel Hawthorne tells us that the Gothic embraces reality, and reality is imperfect. In “The Birthmark,” he uses Georgiana’s blemish to communicate that flawlessness is impossible to attain in reality. It is heavenly – not of this earth. Those who are capable of appreciating her natural mark – those who “would have risked life for the privilege of pressing… lips to the mysterious hand [Giorgiana’s birthmark]” – are the ones who are really living. They worship what is concrete – what is real. And what is real is perverse.</p>

<p>From these artists – truly titans of traditional Gothicism – we see themes of inner-perverseness, imperfection, earthliness and reality. The Gothic, in effect, presents us with an unflattering, yet accurate mirror. It reveals our natural tendencies toward the perverse. It reveals our natural imperfections. And with this perverseness, we are humanized. However, as Hawthorne suggests, it seems to be human nature to deny our faults - to deny what makes us human - and to become so fixated on self-deluded fantasies of perfection. And as a result, we get confused. We adopt a second, fictitious identity that overshadows our true selves. However, this new identity doesn’t quite overlap so seamlessly, and what is covered up obtains a ghostly presence. It’s there, but lurks behind shadows, within the crevices of the artificial layer of perfection - uncanny.</p>

<p>Now, with this information in mind, we can begin to see that the Gothic is more than just the traditional eighteenth century ghost story. Angela Carter captures this notion when she claims that</p>

  <p>The Gothic is all around us, from our everyday lives to the art and culture that our community generates. This exhibit immerses the viewer in the timelessness of the Gothic: from Gregory Crewdson’s uncanny portrayal of the perverse in suburban lifestyle with his photography to the gothic subculture portrayed in <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>. From the out of place, unnatural gaze of the Cindy Sherman’s untitled portraits, to the simply unheimlich clips from <i>Desperate Housewives</i>, this exhibit provides what Ann Radcliffe might characterize as the “terror” of a lifetime!</p> 

<p>In this exhibit, we gather together a series of pop-culture works that do not seem explicitly Gothic, but upon another look, in fact are.</p>

<p>The tour investigates the Gothic presence in pop-culture through three different kinds of media: television, photography, and silhouette cutouts - essentially beginning with a facade most cheery and ending with a true identity most exposed. Excerpts from select episodes of <i>The Big Bang Theory</i> and <i>Desperate Housewives</i> give insight into the contemporary American perception of the Gothic and reveal the timeless (and truly Gothic) sense of a dual identity. In both shows, a dual identity is manifested in the characters and in their relationships.</p>

<p>The exhibit then turns to Gregory Crewdson and Cindy Sherman, both contemporary photographers. In their own respective ways, each illustrates the impossibility of replicating perfection. However, Sherman’s portrait photography, diverging from Crewdson’s suburban landscape scenes, also serves as a depiction of pop-culture media as it dictates the “ideal woman.” As a result, it confuses impressionable youth into obtaining a dual identity: one smothered in makeup and one trapped beneath.</p>

<p>Finally, Kara Walker adds another dimension to the exhibit by bridging the gap between present and past in her exploration of identity of slaves in the antebellum South. In her silhouette cutouts of life on the plantation, Walker reveals a confused identity of slaves… and an unflattering, but clear reflection of the United States, one from which the United States has averted its eyes for so long.</p>
