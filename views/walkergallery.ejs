    Kara Walker, with her cut-out silhouettes of the classic figures on the plantation, reveals the atrocities inflicted on slaves in the antebellum South. Her work is entirely Gothic because it reveals. Her work reveals the veneer of southern gentility as the fictitious identity and exhibits slavery - violence, physical and sexual, a vicious attempt to quash an entire race to increase one’s own self-worth. Walker reveals what a textbook or classroom cannot. This confusing false veneer that covers up the truly savage behavior of most white landowners dehumanized the slaves. They couldn’t leave the plantation because it was unlikely they would all escape. They were alone, their identity lost, hopelessly trapped. In this case, Walker forces the United States to look in the mirror. To see what it has covered up for so many years for what it truly was - far worse than perverse. Wicked. Criminal.

    Walker portrays the overlap between the Gothic confusion of identity and southern enslavement particularly well in the image above. She depicts the subject’s confused identity in two ways. The first is the way in which the subject holds her own head detached from her body. The second is Walker’s rendering another person, seemingly clawing for a way out, inside the subject.

    This image serves as an interesting counterbalance to the other Walker image in this exhibition. While the other work depicts slave conditions (with a seemingly female slave starring as the work’s subject), this image depicts the superficial veneer of “southern gentility” that white landowners used to mask their barbaric treatment of their slaves. On the surface, the image seems to depict a loving and courteous relationship between a man and woman. However, upon a second look, a few elements are out of place and upon another look, these elements appear to be gear meant to constrain slaves. The most obvious of these instances is weapon protruding from the man’s leg, which extends to another body conveniently cut out of the image. This silhouetted image portrays a juxtaposition between the superficial veneer and the wicked interior.
